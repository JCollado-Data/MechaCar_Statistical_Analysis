# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

As we evaluate the MechaCar we can compare it to the competition. We will use Linear Regression and T-test to compare the two types.
We hypotesis that the MechaCar will have better MPG and out perform the competition overall. The null hypothesis is that the competition is better over all. We gathered data covering different aspects of the mechacar and competition to compare all different functions such as mpg, ground clearance, awd and so on.
